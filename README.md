# Coin-Portfolio-App

I created this app because for example , i bought in 2021 Ripple(XRP) coin. When i wanna see bought price or quantity i can't see. They delete logs after some time. Coin Portfolio App is always keeps and show your entry price - current price.

Coin Portfolio is when we bought coins on bitcoin websites/apps it helps us to track our coins , Coin Portfolio is helping to know info about our all coins (like entry price or info about our coins) and current prices with changes.
